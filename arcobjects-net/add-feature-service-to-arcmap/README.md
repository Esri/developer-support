# How to add a feature service to ArcMap as a layer
This is a C# arcobjects sample that shows how to add a feature service to ArcMap as a layer. It also shows how to apply a renderer to your newly created layer. In order to use the original symbology of the feature service (that was being used on the server), comment out the "renderer" part of the code.
