# What is this?

This script can be used to generate and populate Cross_From and Cross_To fields in a road centerlines file. It will read in the Full_Street field of the road centerlines, and identify the cross streets at each intersection. Once the cross streets have been identified, their attributes (names) will be populated into the Cross_From and Cross_To fields which are generated by the script. This script will work in ArcGIS 10.2 and 10.3. It is untested at previous versions.

This is an updated version, in C#, of the [Populate Cross Street Names VBA script from ArcScripts](http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=13213).

# What is required to run this script?

* ArcObjects
* ArcGIS Desktop
* Familiarity with ArcGIS Desktop Addins for .NET
* Three fields:

Cross_From - empty field - Text Field

Cross_To - empty field - Text Field

Full_Stree - Field populated with full street name. (N. Michigan Street)

# Sample Syntax

None.  This was originally designed as an Addin.  Merely append this to one of your addins to create a button to use within ArcMap.

# Use Case

Populates two text fields in a street line feature class based on intersecting streets at the ends of each line.
