#Create SVG patches from Esri symbols

##About
This is a bit of an odd sample but one that I believe is needed. Over the last year I have seen multiple developers ask for guidance on how to create a custom legend for their JavaScript applications. The key problem with creating a custom legend is how to create a legend patch based on the symbology of the layer to be displayed. This application shows how to automatically create an SVG legend patch based on an Esri symbol. This workflow supports SimpleMarkerSymbols, SimpleLineSymbols, SimpleFillSymbols, PictureMarkerSymbols and PictureFillSymbols. How you go about creating a legend using these patches is up to you.
