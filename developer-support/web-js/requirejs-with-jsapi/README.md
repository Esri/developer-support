#RequireJS with ArcGIS API for JavaScript

RequireJS helps developers load multiple files and JavaScript libraries.  Dojo has this framework built-in but cases may arrise where there is a need to put the two together, like we did here.

[ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)

[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)

## Features

* Load libraries the RequireJS way
* Use Esri's JavaScript library to create great online maps 
* Set yourself up for success using Facebook's JavaScript API
* Note Esri has customized the RequireJS text plugin included in this sample
* It's important to know that loading the JSAPI CDN along without RequireJS is faster (but this is a RequireJS / JSAPI Sample) 


NOTE: Feel free to contribute new templates to this repo!
