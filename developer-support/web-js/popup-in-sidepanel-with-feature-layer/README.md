This sample uses simpler version of the JavaScript sample online "Popup Contect in Side panel"
https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jssamples/popup_sidepanel.html

Unlike the sample above which uses ArcGIS.com webmap by id, this adds a feature layer on the map and use the pop up content in a side panel.
Also adds a basemap and dynamic labels in popup!
