#Change Symbology of a Graphic

1. Run the sample, then turn on the drawing toolbar
2. Pick the rectangle drawing tool and draw a graphic (a rectangle)
3. Add this Add-In to a toolbar in ArcMap and click the button
4. The graphic, which was originally yellow, will now change color to
green (it will actually be added back to the screen as a green graphic
element)
Note that Element is an Abstract class in the Carto Namespace. Its
Object model diagram is under Carto Map Elements, and not under Carto
Map and Page layout.
