Publish Feature Service to ArcGIS Server
=========================

## Instructions

1. This is a script tool, so open the tool through ArcCatalog or ArcMap
2. Set the input MXD and the ArcGIS Server Connection file
3. Run the tool

## Use Case

If you need to automate the process of publishing a feature service, this script tool can be used to do so. It is also handy to quickly publish a MXD for testing without needing to go through the Service Editor wizard.


## Limitations

This tool currently only works with ArcGIS Server and does not have support for Portal/AGOL. This could be easily added using the [Sign in to Portal GP Tool](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//00540000001t000000)
