Count Multipart Features
=========================

## Instructions

1. Set the fc variable in the main() function to point to an input point, line, or polygon feature class
2. Run the script
3. The input feature class will have a PartCount field added that will state the number of parts per feature.

## Use Case

This script could be used to identify features with many parts, which could be affecting performance. It could also be used to determine if any features in your feature class are multipart.
