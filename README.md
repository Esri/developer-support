Developer Support
=========================

This project is a place to collaborate and support GIS developers working with Esri's developer libraries.

## Welcome to the Developer Support Repository

Resources for troubleshooting as well as proof of concept samples to support developers!
Much of the code contained here is samples created by Esri staff to help developers understand how to program against all aspects of Esri’s Location Platform – desktop, mobile devices and for the web.  It’s a great place to copy and paste code you may need or search for lesser-known methods or classes to see how they are implemented.  Despite the name however, this repository is not intended as a place to replace community and paid support offered by Esri.  For community support, check out our [Esri’s GeoNet site](https://geonet.esri.com/welcome).  For paid support check out [http://support.esri.com](http://support.esri.com) or contact your regional distributor.

## Using the samples

The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file for this repository. The **Download Zip** link can be found in the top right of the repository by clicking the green **Clone or download** button.

###### Notes:

* The resulting zip archive will contain ALL samples for this repository.

* In Windows, before you unzip, you may need to unblock the archive.  Right-click the zip file, select **Properties**, then select **Unblock**.

* The general organization of the repository is:  **[Technology Platform]-[Language]/[Sample Name]**

* Many of the samples will require installation of supporting software (e.g. a respective SDK). See the sample readme for dependencies.

For more information regarding the technology platforms, languages, APIs, and SDKs, please refer to the documentation at: [ArcGIS for Developers - Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/#extending-the-arcgis-platform)
