# Graphic Overlay Extensions
## What are these extension functions for?
These extension functions are for the [GraphicsOverlay class](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/latest/api-reference/reference/com/esri/arcgisruntime/mapping/view/GraphicsOverlay.html)

## How do I contribute?
Append your extension to the `GraphicOverlayExt.kt` file and then post a short description of the extension function on this page (preferably in the order you added it to the file)

## Functions

### pulseOpacity(period: Long)
This function pulses the opacity of an entire graphics overlay layer. This helps notify the user of selected locations on the screen by giving a visual cue with the opacity change.
