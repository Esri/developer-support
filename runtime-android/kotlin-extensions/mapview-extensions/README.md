# MapView Extensions
## What are these extension functions for?
These extension functions are for the [MapView class](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/latest/api-reference/reference/com/esri/arcgisruntime/mapping/view/MapView.html)

## How do I contribute?
Append your extension to the `MapViewExt.kt` file and then post a short description of the extension function on this page (preferably in the order you added it to the file)

## Functions

### disableRotation()
Disables the rotation on a mapview.  In a previous release of the Android runtime, there was a method to disable the rotation but this does not exist in the new version.
