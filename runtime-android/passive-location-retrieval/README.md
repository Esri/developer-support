# Passive Location Retrieval

## Use case:
A battery safe way to retrieve location updates is needed so you can keep track of assets without the need to actively update the location information.  The update interval really depends on the amount of updates that are sent out by other apps.  What this service does is performs actions when a location update occurs from another application.
