# Sample to generate an offline geodatabase and then synchronize the content back to a Feature Service and enterprise geodatabase

This sample has two buttons.  One makes a call to a Feature Service to download an offline
geodatabase.  The other button synchronizes the geodatabase back to a Feature Service.
When using this sample you may need to change the Feature Service URL and path where the offline 
geodatabase will be stored on the Android device.
