#Drag and drop CSV to perform batch Geocoding

This is a very basic sample that performs batch geocoding by dragging and droping a CSV file onto the map.
Once the CSV file containing addresses is dropped, the map will display the address locations. The
sample requires that browsers support HTML5.  This sample was inspired by the GeoNet post titled Geocode CSV in JavaScript, found [here](https://geonet.esri.com/thread/107874).


## Features

* Code showing how to work with HTML5 FileReader API
* Contains logic for reading CSV file into the format needed for batch geocoding
* Uses Open Street Map

##Instructions
1. Move .html to web server directory
2. Update the ``` tokenkey ``` variable with a valid ArcGIS Token
3. Save the sample.csv file to your computer 
4. Load the index.html file into a browser that supports HTML5
5. Drag and drop the sample.csv onto the map and enjoy
