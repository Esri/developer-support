## Leverage Esri Leaflet in an Angular application

This sample demonstrates how to utilize the [esri leaflet](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet) extension for [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) in an Angular app on the fly.

The demo relies on directives for Leaflet authored by [**@tombatossals**](http://github.com/tombatossals) that can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/tombatossals/angular-leaflet-directive).
