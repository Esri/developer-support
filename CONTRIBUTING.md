#Contributing

Esri welcomes contributions from anyone and everyone. Please see our [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/esri/contributing).

### Before filing an issue

If you're just looking for help, you'll probably attract the most attention if you post in [GIS Stackexchange](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=esri-leaflet,leaflet) or [GeoNet](https://geonet.esri.com/community/discussions-lobby).

### I want to contribute, how do I go about it?

In general, we enforce a [fork and pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) model for new contributions to this repository. This model applies to both the members of the community at large and for our core contributing team.

If you're new to forking, you can find an excellent resource to get more familiar with the general steps [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

Also, this [guide](SUBMITPR.md) outlines the steps for submitting a pull request.

Feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/Esri/developer-support/issues/new) if you get stuck, we're happy to help!
